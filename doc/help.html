<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<todo> Lance, write intro to Integration Suite. </todo>


<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>
The MOEDivcon Integration Suite is part of the QuantumBio Distribution,
which is packaged in a
<inline>tar.gz</inline> file that uses the following naming convention
<inline>quantumbio-&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</inline>.  Move
the file where you wish to install the QuantumBio software (e.g.,
<inline>/usr/local</inline>), then uncompress and untar the file.
<pre>
&gt; tar  -zxvf  quantumbio-&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
</pre>
We will
use <inline>$QBHOME</inline> to refer to the path where the package is
installed.  For instance, if you install linux version 5.0.0.1 in
the <inline>/usr/local</inline> directory,
<inline>$QBHOME</inline> will
refer to <inline>/usr/local/quantumbio-linux-5.0.0.1</inline>.

<p><a name="install-menu"></a>
The final steps of the installation set up your environment to run MOEDivcon.
First, you need to copy the MOEDivcon menu file to your home directory.  If
you already have a custom MOE menu, you need to concatenate the files.
For example, either
<pre>
&gt; cp  ${QBHOME}/moe-menus  ${HOME}/moe-menus
</pre>
or
<pre>
&gt; cat  ${YOURMENUDIR}/moe-menus  ${QBHOME}/moe-menus  >  ${HOME}/moe-menus
</pre>

<p><a name="install-svl"></a>
In order for
MOE to locate the MOEDivcon SVL library, you must create a link to the
library in a place where MOE can find it.  If you already have a directory
of SVL scripts, link the MOEDivcon SVL libarary as a subdirectory.
For example:
<pre>
&gt; ln -s  ${QBHOME}/svl  ${MOE_SVL_PATH}/qb_lib.svl
</pre>
Otherwise, create an SVL directory in your home directory and link the
MOEDivcon SVL library under it.  For example:
<pre>
&gt; mkdir  ${HOME}/svl<br>
&gt; ln -s  ${QBHOME}/svl  ${HOME}/svl/qb_lib.svl<br>
</pre>

<p><a name="install-path"></a>
Before you can run MOEDivcon Suite using MOE or moebatch, 
you need to make sure that
the MOEDivcon executables are in your path and the MOEDivcon SVL library is in
your MOE run path.  For example, you should add to your .bashrc file:
<pre>
export  PATH=${QBHOME}/bin:${PATH}<br>
if [ -z  $MOE_SVL_RUNPATH ] ; then<br>
  export  MOE_SVL_RUNPATH="${QBHOME}/svl"<br>
else<br>
  export  MOE_SVL_RUNPATH="${QBHOME}/svl:$MOE_SVL_RUNPATH"<br>
fi<br>
</pre>
or add to your .cshrc file:
<pre>
setenv  PATH  ${QBHOME}/bin:${PATH}<br>
if ( $?MOE_SVL_RUNPATH ) then<br>
  setenv  MOE_SVL_RUNPATH  ${QBHOME}/svl:$MOE_SVL_RUNPATH<br>
else<br>
  setenv  MOE_SVL_RUNPATH  ${QBHOME}/svl<br>endif<br>
</pre>

<p><a name="install-license"></a>
Finally, MOEDivcon is distributed with an evaluation license that will
eventually
expire. Contact sales@quantumbioinc.com to purchase a license file.
Once you have received a license file
from QuantumBio, you can install the file with a simple move statement.
<pre>
&gt; mv  license-file  $QBHOME/etc/license
</pre>
If you are having difficulties with the installation, see the
<a href="#contact">Support Contact Information</a> section.

<h2><a name="start"></a>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
To verify that the installation was successful, let's work through a few
simple examples of QMScore.  If you run into any problems, 
see the <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section.
<p>
The workflow of MOEDivcon QMScore involves six steps:
<ol>
  <li> Prepare the receptors and ligands/poses involved in the calculation.
  <li> Closely examine all error and warning produced by the MOEDivcon tests
       to ensure that the receptor(s) and ligand(s) are not problematic.
  <li> Verify the formal charges calculated by MOE.
  <li> Set up the run parameters to QMScore.
  <li> Execute QMScore either on a local machine or in parallel on a cluster.
  <li> Analyze the QMScore results.
</ol>

<h3><a name="start-onetoone"></a>One-to-One Mode</h3>
<p>
First, start MOE and open
<inline>${QBHOME}/examples/simplecomplex.moe</inline>.  Then,
select the MOE menu
<w>Compute</w>&rarr;<w>Simulations</w>&rarr;<w>QuantumBio</w>&rarr;<w>QMScore</w>.
<p>
<object id="MOEwithMenu" title="Moe Window with QuantumBio Menu" width=1000
data="images/mainwithmenu.png" type=image/png>
Moe Window with QuantumBio Menu
</object>
<p>
The QMScore panel should appear with the default values.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreDefaultDialog" title="QMScore Panel"
data="images/qmscoredefault.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Panel
</object>
<p>
Ensure that the <w>Working Dir</w> is
<inline>/tmp</inline> (files for storing intermediate calculations and logs
 will be written here).  Press the <w>Run</w> button.  If all goes
well, QMScore will execute using the receptor and ligand complex shown in
the MOE Window.  After several seconds, the MOE database Viewer should open
the QMScore database showing the results.  

<todo>Change to reflect use of HDF5.</todo>Note that the DivCon temporary
files in <inline>/tmp</inline> are deleted when DivCon returns successfully.

<p>
<object id="QMScoreDatabase" title="QMScore Database" width=1000 
data="images/qmscoredatabase.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Database
</object>
<p>
In this simple example, you were able to perform all four workflow steps
in one session within the MOE Window, probably not something you would wish
to do with a large protein receptor for which the execution time may take
several hours.
<h3><a name="start-onetomany"></a>One-to-Many Mode</h3>
<p>
The real power of MOEDivcon Integration Suite
is the ability to use moebatch to execute tasks in parallel on a cluster
and collate the results in a MOE database.  In this case, start MOE and open
<inline>${QBHOME}/examples/simplecomplex.moe</inline> and select the MOE menu
<w>Compute</w>&rarr;<w>Simulations</w>&rarr;<w>QuantumBio</w>&rarr;<w>QMScore</w>.
Select the <w>One-to-Many</w> mapping mode.  Browse for the poses database
and select <inline>${QBHOME}/examples/simpleposes.mdb</inline>.  In the
<w>Charges</w> section, select <w>All Poses</w> since the database contains 
different poses of the same ligand.  Your settings should look like:
<p>
<object id="QMScoreOptionsOneToMany" title="QMScore One-to-Many Options"
data="images/qmscoreoptionsonetomany.png" type=image/png>
QMScore One-to-Many Options
</object>
<p>
Press <w>Save</w> and verify that the charges and other data for the poses
are okay (the
<w>Status</w> field is empty).  Close the MOE Database Viewer and execute
the following command from the directory where <inline>qmscore.mdb</inline>
is located (assuming you have 4 processors on your workstation):
<pre>
&gt; moebatch -mpu 4 -exec "run ['qmsbatch.svl', ['qmscore.mdb']]" -exit
</pre>
Or alternatively, close the MOE Database Viewer and click the <w>Run</w> button
and the jobs will be executed sequentially in the current MOE session (not
recommended for large proteins).
<p>
MOEDivcon will print out progress messages for one of the jobs.  When all
four jobs are completed, open <inline>qmscore.mdb</inline> in the MOE
Database Viewer.  You should see results similar to these:
<p>
<object id="QMScoreDatabaseOneToMany" title="QMScore One-to-Many Database" width=1000 
data="images/qmscoredatabaseonetomany.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Database
</object>
See the <a href="#parallel">Batch and Parallel Execution</a> section for more
information on executing moebatch in parallel on a cluster.
<h3><a name="start-manytomany"></a>Many-to-Many Mode</h3>
<p>
In Many-to-Many Mode, MOEDivcon doesn't use the molecules in the MOE Window,
so after starting MOE, selecting <w>QMScore</w> from the menu system,
and selecting
<w>Many-to-Many</w> mapping mode, and you can proceed directly to browsing
for the receptor database (<inline>${QBHOME}/examples/simplerecs.mdb</inline>) 
and ligand database (<inline>${QBHOME}/examples/simpleligands.mdb</inline>).
Your settings should look like:
<p>
<object id="QMScoreOptionsManyToMany" title="QMScore Many-to-Many Options"
data="images/qmscoreoptionsmanytomany.png" type=image/png>
QMScore One-to-Many Options
</object>
<p>
Note that the <w>Charges</w> section is inactivated; the charges are
calculated as the receptors and ligands are copied to the QMScore database.
Press <w>Save</w> and verify that the charges and other data for both 
the receptors and ligands are okay (the
<w>Status</w> field is empty).  Close the MOE Database Viewer and execute
the following command from the directory where <inline>qmscore.mdb</inline>
is located (assuming you have 4 processors on your workstation):
<pre>
&gt; moebatch -mpu 4 -exec "run ['qmsbatch.svl', ['qmscore.mdb']]" -exit
</pre>
The execution will take longer since there are twelve jobs to run.  When all
twelve jobs are completed, open <inline>qmscore.mdb</inline> in the MOE
Database Viewer.  You should see results similar to these:
<p>
<object id="QMScoreDatabaseManyToMany" title="QMScore Many-to-Many Database" width=1000 
data="images/qmscoredatabasemanytomany.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Database

See the <a href="#parallel">Batch and Parallel Execution</a> section for more
information on executing moebatch in parallel on a cluster.


<h2><a name="core"></a>MOEDivcon Core</h2>
<h3><a name="core-intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>
MOEDivcon Core encompasses the GUI form and functionality that is shared by all
of the Score Calculation panels in the MOEDivcon Integration Suite.  It includes
a set of molecular tests to capture common structural problems in the protein 
receptor(s) and ligand(s) before they are sent to DivCon for evalutation.  It
also includes a verification that the charges calculated by MOE are compatible
with DivCon.  It includes basic functionality such as saving and loading
MOEDivcon Score database, and options common to all scoring calculations.
Finally, it includes the support for setting up jobs to run in batch mode and
the ability to execute jobs in parallel on either a workstation or computing
cluster.

<h3><a name="core-test"></a>Molecule Tests</h3>
<p>
MOEDivcon is able to perform several tests on the receptor(s) and ligand(s) to
determine if there are possible problems with the molecular structures.  The 
"Error" tests check whether there are problems that will definitely cause DivCon
to fail and the "Warning" tests check for other possible problems that may or
may not cause DivCon to fail (or not converge), but may cause questionable
calculation results.
<p>
Because the tests can be computationally intensive on large proteins
and sometimes report false positives,
you are able to select which tests are performed during setup.
You should turn off the tests only if you are sure the receptor(s) and ligand(s)
have been cleaned up and are correctly parsed by MOE.
<p>
The "Error" tests are always performed on the receptor and ligand in the MOE
Window when you click <w>Run</w> or <w>Save</w> in <w>One-to-One</w> or
<w>One-to-Many</w> mode.  If any problems  that will cause DivCon to fail are
detected, you are asked whether you wish to continue.  The selected tests are
also performed on any receptors and/or ligands/poses as they are copied into
the MOEDivcon Score database in <w>One-to-Many</w> or <w>Many-to-Many</w> mode.  The
results of the tests are stored in the <w>Status</w> field of the 
MOEDivcon Score database so that you may verify the test results.
<p>
The "Error" tests are always performed by MOEDivcon before passing the
receptor and ligand to DivCon for calculation.  If any of the "Error" tests
fail, the calculation will be skipped.  The "Error" and selected "Warning"
test results are stored in the <w>Status</w> field of the MOEDivcon Score 
database.
<p>
For each atom that is detected to be problematic, MOEDivcon prints information
that makes it easy to locate the atom using MOE's Atom Manager.  The 
statement has the following format:
<pre>
AtomIndex: AtomName in ResidueIndex: ResidueName ResidueUID
</pre>
where the AtomIndex is MOE's index in the system, not the residue.  
The ResidueIndex is MOE's index of the residue in the system, 
and ResidueUID is ID field from
the PDB file, say.  Below is an example error and warning tests report.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreErrorReport" title="QMScore Error and Warning Tests Report"
data="images/qmscoreerrorreport.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Error and Warning Tests Report
</object>
<p>

<h4><a name="core-test-lp"></a>Lone Pairs</h4>
<p>
This is an "Error" test.
DivCon doesn't recognize MOE's <inline>LP</inline> (lone pair) element name and
will immediately abort the calculation of a molecule that contains one.  The
most likely reason for a lone pair appearing in a molecule is that MOE had
problems parsing a PDB file, in particular the Atom Name field.

<h4><a name="core-test-overlap"></a>Atom Overlap</h4>
<p>
This is an "Error" test.
Not unexpectedly, DivCon has serious convergence problems if there are atoms
that are overlapping (&lt; 0.5 &#197;).  This test checks for intramolecular
atom overlap; that is, whether any two atoms in the ligand are too close to 
each other, or any two atoms in the receptor collection, which may include 
solvents, cofactors, etc.  This test detects structural problems that may be
difficult to see with a 3D molecular viewer.  This test also checks for
intermolecular atom overlap; that is between receptor and ligand atoms.  At
the moment, the test uses a simple heuristic that will be improved over time
to account for H-bonds, for example.

<h4><a name="core-test-hamcompat"></a>Hamiltonian Compatibility</h4>
<p>
This is an "Error" test.
If there exists an element in either the receptor or ligand for which the
selected Hamiltonian has not been parameterized, DivCon is going to eventually
abort its calculation.  This test captures that failure event before performing
any time-consuming calculations.

<h4><a name="core-test-h"></a>Missing/Extra H</h4>
<p>
This is a "Warning" test.
The most common reasons for a missing H are truncated residues in proteins
and misinterpreted bond orders in ligands.  The most common reason for an
extra H in proteins are protonated carbonyl oxygens (C=O&rarr;C=OH).   Other
problems are caused by incorrect charges, metal coordinations, etc.
<p>
This test can also generate false positives.  MOEDivcon already filters out
the most common source of false positives:  terminal amines in proteins
treated by MOE as ammonion cations. 
<p>
It is recommended that you verify the correctness of the molecular structure
if you receive this warning.

<h4><a name="core-test-mm"></a>Undefined MM Atom Type</h4>
<p>
This is a "Warning" test.  If MOE was unable to determine the molecular
mechanics atom type, it's very likely that there is a serious problem with
the structure.  If an atom has a problem detected by the other tests, it 
is often listed under this test as well.  It also detects problems not
caught by the other tests such as truncated residues, incorrect charges on
metals, incorrect bond orders on sulphates, sulfoxides, sulfonyls, 
phosphates, and orthovanadate ions, metal coordinations problems, etc.
<p>
It is recommended that you verify the correctness of the molecular structure
if you receive this warning.

<h3><a name="core-charge"></a>Charges</h3>
<p>
After correct coordinates, the second most important molecular descriptor on
which DivCon depends is the total charge. DivCon calculations
rely on an accurate total charge in order to properly characterize a molecule.
Improper or incorrect charges can result in poor energies, convergence problems,
questionable geometries, and incorrect partial charges. The total charge can
also yield a system with an odd number of electrons. Such systems are not only
highly unusual in biological problems, they are also incompatible the with
underlying Restricted Hatree Fock (RHF) algorithm within DivCon. 
MOE is capable of determining the charge based upon bond order, protonation,
and analogous characteristics. In the event that the charge is incorrectly 
determined, it is suggested that the user edit the structure using MOE's
molecule Builder. Please see the MOE documentation for more information. 
<p>
When you open any of the MOEDivcon Score panels, MOE calculates the total
charge of the
receptor and ligand in the MOE window, and displays them in the
<w>Charges</w> section.  You can press the <w>Calculate</w> button to
recalculate the charges.

<h4><a name="core-charge-status"></a>Status</h4>
<p>
The colored cirles next to the charges reflect the status of the charge
calculation:
<table border="1">
<tr><th class="white">&#X25CF;<td>Uncalculated or user-entered charge.
<tr><th class="green">&#X25CF;<td>Charge calculated by MOE.
<tr><th class="red">&#X25CF;<td>Problematic charge for DivCon.
</table>
<p>
Note that the green circle doesn't mean that the charge is correct, only that
it has been calculated.  As with any other formal charge algorithm, MOE 
doesn't always get the total charge right.  You can edit the
charges calculated by MOE if you think they are incorrect or they are marked
as problematic for DivCon.  If you modify the charges in the 
MOEDivcon Score panel,
MOEDivcon will alert you if a charge you entered may cause problems with the
DivCon calculations when you press <w>Run</w> or <w>Save</w>.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreBadCharge" title="QMScore Charge Error"

MOEDivcon Score Charge Error
</object>

<h4><a name="core-charge-onetomany"></a>One-to-Many</h4>
<p>
When in <w>One-to-Many</w> mode, you can choose
to use the charge specified for the ligand as the charge for all the poses
by selecting <w>All Poses</w>.  Otherwise, the charge is calculated for
each pose as it is copied from the Ligand/Pose database to the
MOEDivcon Score database.  In either case, when the MOEDivcon Score database
is opened with
the MOE Database Viewer for verification.  If a calculated charge is
problematic for DivCon, it is noted in the <w>Status</w> column (double 
click cell to see entire message).  DivCon calculations for molecules with
problematic charges are skipped.

<h4><a name="core-charge-manytomany"></a>Many-to-Many</h4>
<p>
When in <w>Many-to-Many</w> mode, the <w>Charges</w>
section is disabled.  The charges for the receptors and ligands are calculated
as they are copied from their respective databases into the MOEDivcon Score
database.  Again, you can verify and edit the charges using the MOE Database
Viewer.  DivCon calculations for molecules with problematic charges are skipped.

<h4><a name="core-charge-editing"></a>Editing</h4>
<p>
You can edit the charges stored in the MOEDivcon Score database by double
clicking
on the cell and edit the charge in the edit bar at the top of the window.
Afterwards, you can press the <w>Check</w> button in the <w>Charges</w>
section of the panel to ask MOEDivcon to recheck the charges in the 
MOEDivcon Score
database.  If a charge is still problematic, a warning message appears in
the <w>Status</w> column.  Otherwise, an okay message is written.
<p>
Before passing the run parameters to DivCon
during execution, MOEDivcon checks again whether the charges are
going to be problematic.  If so, it skips the calculation and places a
message in the <w>Status</w> column.
<p>
<warn>Warning:  When you edit a cell in a MOE database, the new value is
directly written to disk and the previous value is lost.</warn>

<h3><a name="core-load"></a>Load and Save</h3>
<p>
You can load an existing MOEDivcon Score database into the MOEDivcon Score
panel by pressing the <w>Load</w> button.  A file selection box will open
allowing
you to browse for the MOEDivcon Score database.  When you select a MOE database, it is checked to make
sure it is a MOEDivcon Score database.  The receptor/ligand complex stored in
the database is then loaded into the MOE window, the MOEDivcon Score panel is
updated with the settings stored in the database, and then the database itself
is opened using the MOE Database Viewer.
<p>
 If you load an existing MOEDivcon Score database, change the options or edit
the receptor or ligand using MOE's Builder, then press <w>Save</w>, the updated
options, molecules and charges will be saved in the output database.
<p>
If you load an existing MOEDivcon Score database and only edit some of the
<w>Rec Chg</w> or <w>Lig Chg</w> fields, you shouldn't press the
MOEDivcon Score <w>Save</w> button.  This would regenerate the original charges
calculated from the molecules in the MOE Window, and/or those stored in the
recepter and pose database specified in MOEDivcon Score panel.  When you edit
an entry in a MOE database, it is written directly to disk.  See the
<a href="#charge-edit">Editing</a> charge section for more information.
<p>
<warn>Warning:  When you load a database, the current settings in the
MOEDivcon Score panel and the molecules in the MOE Window are replaced
and may be lost if not saved beforehand.</warn>

<h3><a name="core-clean"></a>Log Files and Postexecution Cleanup</h3>
<p>
<todo>Change to reflect use of HDF5.</todo>
If a DivCon job runs successfully, MOEDivcon automatically deletes
temporary files in the working directory.  This prevents DivCon from attempting
to reuse files from an earlier run and avoids wasting disk space. However,
if an error is reported the files are not deleted and the location of the
DivCon log file is written to the <w>Status</w> column of the MOEDivcon Score
database along with the error message.  The location has the format:
<pre>
        hostname:/path/to/working/directory/divcon.log
</pre>
The hostname is useful if the job ran on a cluster and you are not sure on
which particular machine.  This allows you to examine the DivCon output and
logs if you need more information about why the error occurred.  It also makes
it easier for you to find the working directory in order to delete the
temporary files post-mortem.

<h3><a name="core-parallel"></a>Batch and Parallel Execution</h3>
<p>
As described in the <a href="#start">Getting Started</a> section, the workflow
of MOEDivcon QMSore proceeds in six steps:  preparation, testing, verification,
set up, execution, and analysis.  The prep, testing, verification, set up, and
analysis steps are performed using MOE on your local workstation or laptop.
The third step, execution, is best left to a computational cluster, whether 
you are scoring one complex or hundreds.
<p>
Before getting into the details of executing moebatch on a cluster, we'll
explain how to setup MOEDivcon QMScore to run a single job in batch mode or
many jobs in parallel.  Analogous steps are performed to set up MOEDivcon
NMRScore batch jobs.

<h4><a name="core-parallel-mode"></a>Mapping Mode</h4>
<p>
The mapping mode determines how receptors are to be mapped to ligands (poses).

<h5><a name="core-parallel-mode-1to1"></a>One Receptor--One Ligand</h5>
<p>
In <w>One-to-One</w> batch mode, the set up is the same as in the
<a href="#start">Getting Started</a> section.  Open the receptor
and ligand files into the MOE Window and perform any necessary preparatory,
testing and verification steps.
Next, open the QMScore panel and select your options, and then choose
<w>Save</w> rather than <w>Run</w>.  MOEDivcon will store your receptor,
ligand, and
options in the QMScore database, and then open the MOE Database Viewer so you
can verify the ligand/pose data.  See the
<a href="#parallel-moebatch">Running Moebatch</a> section
to learn how to execute the job.

<h5><a name="core-parallel-mode-1toM"></a>One Receptor--Many Ligand Poses</h5>
<p>
In <w>One-to-Many</w> parallel mode, MOEDivcon scores many ligand poses
generated by your favorite docking program against the same receptor.  The set
up is similar to <a href="#parallel-mode-1to1"><w>One-to-One</w></a> mode in
that MOEDivcon expects the receptor/ligand complex to be in the MOE Window.
The difference is that you need to create a MOE database to store the ligand
poses beforehand (see the MOE documentation if you are not familiar with
this process).
<p>
Open the receptor and ligand files into the MOE Window, open the QMScore
panel and choose your
options.  When you select the <w>One-to-Many</w> mode, you will be prompted
to supply a ligand/pose database.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreOneToMany" title="QMScore One-to-Many Mode"
data="images/qmscoreonetomany.png" type=image/png >
QMScore One-to-Many Mode
</object>
<p>
You can choose to view all poses simultaneously in the MOE Window by selecting
<w>All Poses</w> in the Mapping Mode section.
You can also choose
to use the charge specified for the ligand as the charge for all the poses
by selecting <w>All Poses</w> in the Charge section.  
See the <a href="#charge-onetomany">Charge</a>
section to learn more details about how MOEDivcon handles charges.
<p>
When you choose <w>Save</w>,  MOEDivcon will store your receptor, ligand, and
options in the QMScore database, and it will copy the ligand/pose database into
the QMScore database including any data fields (e.g., results from other scoring
algorithms).  The MOE Database Viewer will then open the QMScore database so
you can verify the ligand/pose data, especially the charge values and status.
See the
<a href="#parallel-moebatch">Running Moebatch</a>
section to learn how to execute the job.
<p>
<h5><a name="core-parallel-mode-MtoM"></a>Many Receptors--Many Ligands</h5>
<p>
In the <w>Many-to-Many</w> parallel mode, MOEDivcon scores many receptors,
each against its own ligand.  In this case, MOEDivcon gathers the molecular
information from the two databases you need to supply.  Additionally, it
is up to the user to assure that the receptors and ligands are stored in the
correct order in the MOE databases.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreManyToMany" title="QMScore Many-to-Many Mode"
data="images/qmscoremanytomany.png" type=image/png>
QMScore Many-to-Many Mode
</object>
<p>
When you choose <w>Save</w>,  MOEDivcon will store your options in the
QMScore database, and it will copy the receptor and ligand databases, row
by row, into the QMScore database including any data fields.  The MOE
Database Viewer will then open the QMScore database so you can verify the
receptor and ligand data, especially the charge values and status.
See the <a href="#parallel-moebatch">Running Moebatch</a> section
to learn how to execute the job.  See the
<a href="#charge-manytomany">Charge</a>
section to learn more details about how MOEDivcon handles charges.
<p>
<warn>Warning:  If the receptor and pose databases have fields&ndash;other than
the molecule field&ndash;with the same name, then the pose data will overwrite
the receptor data for those fields.</warn>


<h4><a name="core-parallel-moebatch"></a>Running Moebatch</h4>
<p>
After you close the database, you can execute MOEDivcon QMScore in at least
three different ways.  In the examples below, <inline>$USER_DATADB</inline>
is the path to your QMScore database.  Analogous steps are performed to execute
MOEDivcon NMRScore.
<p>
You can run moebatch on your workstation from the command line:
<pre>
&gt; moebatch -mpu N -exec "run ['qmsbatch.svl', ['$USER_DATADB']]" -exit
</pre>
where <inline>N</inline> is the number of local processors to use.
<p>
You can run moebatch on a LAN:
<pre>
moebatch -mpu moedivcon_machinefile -exec "run ['qmsbatch.svl', ['$USER_DATADB']]" -exit
</pre>
where <inline>moedivcon_machinefile</inline> is the MOE machine file, which
has the following format:
<pre>
localhost ssh hostname01 'moebatch -mpu -'
localhost ssh hostname01 'moebatch -mpu -'
localhost ssh hostname02 'moebatch -mpu -'
localhost ssh hostname02 'moebatch -mpu -'
localhost ssh hostname03 'moebatch -mpu -'
localhost ssh hostname03 'moebatch -mpu -'
$eof
</pre>
The first hostname must be the host from where you launch the
<inline>moebatch -mpu moedivcon_machinefile</inline> command.
You may repeat a hostname in the MOE machine file if you wish to use more
than one processor on that compute node.  In the above example, two processors
are used on the three compute nodes.  The MOE maching file must end with
<inline>$eof</inline>.  The number of processors should not exceed the number
of available MOE licenses.  See the MOE/smp documentation
for more details on the machine file.
<p>
You can
also execute moebatch by submitting the job to a cluster queue.  Example
scripts for PBS and SGE are located in <inline>${QBHOME}/scripts</inline>.
For example, below is the script for submitting a parallel job to PBS
using bash (<inline>${QBHOME}/scripts/moedivconbatch_bash.pbs</inline>):
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -S /bin/bash
#  Warning:  the number of processors (nodes * ppn) should not exceed the
#  number of available MOE licenses.
#PBS -l nodes=6:ppn=2
#PBS -j oe

hostname
date
cat $PBS_NODEFILE
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Generate the MOE machine file from the PBS list of processors.
rm -f moedivcon_machinefile
for mach in $( cat $PBS_NODEFILE ); do
   echo "localhost ssh $mach 'moebatch -mpu -'" >> moedivcon_machinefile
done
echo "\$eof" >> moedivcon_machinefile

# Change the path and name for the MOE database.
USER_DATADB="$PWD/qmscore.mdb"

moebatch -mpu moedivcon_machinefile -exec "run ['qmsbatch.svl', ['$USER_DATADB']]" -exit
</pre>
The script requests the number of proccessors to use in the batch job and
uses the list of nodes in the <inline>PBS_NODEFILE</inline> to automatically
generate the MOE machine file.  Note that the number of processors you can
use is limited by the number of MOE licenses you have been granted.

<h3><a name="core-options"></a>Core Options</h3>
<p>
Here we include a more detailed description of the core options in the MOEDivcon
Score panel.

<h4><a name="core-options-outdb"></a>Output MOE Database</h4>
<p>
MOEDivcon uses a MOE database to store run parameters and to store
Score results; and if appropriate, analysis results.  
One advantage is that the database is self-contained:  all
of the data and parameters needed to execute MOEDivcon Score jobs are stored
in the database.  The database can be moved to a working directory prior to
execution time as long as the correct path is provided to the moebatch
command (see the <a href="#parallel-moebatch">Running Moebatch</a>
section for more information).  Another advantage is the suite of MOE
data analysis tools designed to work with its database.

<h4><a name="core-options-workdir"></a>Working Directory</h4>
<p>
<todo>Change to reflect use of HDF5.</todo>

The working directory is used for storing QuantumBio DivCon intermediate
calculations and log files.  The path to the specified directory will
be stored in the MOEDivcon Score database and resolved at execution time.
If you are
going to submit the MOEDivcon Score job on a cluster, you can specify
the absolute
path to a scratch directory mounted on the cluster's file system.  Because of
this possible scenerio, there is no check whether the directory actually
exists.  If MOEDivcon Score job is executed using moebatch, a subdirectory
under the
working directory named <inline>qb_out<em>N</em></inline>
will be created for each numbered task <inline><em>N</em></inline>.
<p>
An alternative to specifying a working directory is to use the <w>CWD</w>
option.
<p>
<object id="QMScoreCWD" title="QMScore CWD Option"
data="images/qmscorecwd.png" type=image/png>
QMScore CWD Option
</object>
<p>
In this case the current working directory will be set using the run time
environment variable <inline>$PWD</inline>.  This is effectively equivalent
to specifying <inline>'.'</inline> as the working directory.  If you use
the <w>CWD</w> option when executing in moebatch parallel mode, each child task
will create a subdirectory under the current working directory of the moebatch
process.

<h4><a name="core-options-ham"></a>Hamiltonian</h4>
<p>
Several options are available in chosing the Hamiltonian algorithm to use
with each MOEDivcon Score calculation, each with its own default:  PM3 has 
proven to be the most reliable for QMScore and MNDO for NMRScore.

<h4><a name="core-options-scaling"></a>Scaling</h4>
<p>
Linear vs. Cubic referrs to the scaling factor of the calculation where
Linear scales accordingly to O(n) and Cubic scaling is the more conventional
variety (e.g. O(n&sup3;) or worse) where n corresponds to the number of
electrons in the system. The cross over point is at approximately 450 atoms.

<h3><a name="qms-intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Analogous to conventional scoring functions from other vendors, QuantumBio
provides a scoring function based upon linear-scaling, semi-empirical, quantum
mechanics. This patent pending algorithm characterizes the entire target/ligand
complex quantum mechanically, and determines the energy of binding.
<p>
The QMScore algorithm has been validated against several key structural motifs,
and the results of these validations have been detailed in several
key peer-reviewed

<h4><a name="qms-options-shift"></a>Shift</h4>
<p>
User-defined initial dynamic level shift parameter in eV.

<h4><a name="qms-options-opt"></a>Ligand Optimization</h4>
<p>
A QM-based ligand optimization can be performed prior to scoring.
This optimization may occur either while the ligand is docked within
the target or while the ligand is separate from the target.
Warning: this optional step will significantly increase the CPU cost
of the calculation.

<h4><a name="qms-options-freq"></a>Frequency</h4>

<h4><a name="pwd-options-residues"></a>Residues</h4>
<p>
In order to produce meaningful results during the PLS statistical analysis,
it is necessary to prune out residues that do not contribute any information.

<h5><a name="pwd-options-residues-pzero"></a>Pruning:  Percent Zero</h5>
<p>
Residues that are distant from the pocket have little if any interaction with
the poses and have mostly zero values for the energy terms in the scoring
function.  The inclusion of these residues in the analysis can distort the
PLS calculations.  Any residues with more than the given percentage of zero
energy values are pruned.  The default is set at 95 percent zero values.

<h5><a name="pwd-options-residues-pSD"></a>Pruning:  Minimum SD</h5>
<p>
Residues that have the same interaction, whether weak or strong, with all of
the poses offer little information in discriminating one pose from another.
The PLS calculations are more reliable if these residues are not included in
the analysis.  Any residues with a smaller standard deviation of energy
values than the given SD are pruned. The default SD is set at 0.05.


<h5><a name="pwd-options-residues-ntop"></a>Number of Top Scoring Residues</h5>
<p>
Even with the pruning above, the majority of the remaining residues often
contribute little to the scoring function of the poses and offer little
information in the Interaction and SAR Heat Maps.  You can specify here the
number of top scoring residues to keep, which depends on the nature and size
of the protein pocket.
<p>
Note that the current implementation of QB Heat Map can show a maximum of
30 residues.

<h4><a name="pwd-options-pls"></a>PLS</h4>
<p>
Partial Least Squares models are built to describe the structure-activity of
the ligand poses.  Internal validation is carried out using Leave-One-Out (LOO)
cross-validation for the training set and the optimal dimensionality of each
model is assigned from its cross-validation predictive ability.  The optimal
PLS model is determined by the cross-validated correlation coefficient 
(Q<sup>2</sup>) values.


<h5><a name="pwd-options-pls-ncomps"></a>Number of Components</h5>
<p>
Enter the number of components to include in the model during the PLS analysis.


<h5><a name="pwd-options-pls-trainset"></a>Training Set Size</h5>
<p>
Enter the size of the training set.  The first N poses (Pose 1 ... Pose N) are
treated as the training set, and the remaining are treated as the prediction
set.  The receptor and ligand molecules can be ordered so that the training set
molecules appear first when the receptor and pose MDB databases are created, or
the entries in the databases can be rearranged after the database have been
created (see the MOE documentation).

<h3><a name="pwd-analysis"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>
There are several post analysis datasets that you can select:
<ul>
  <li>PLS Results Table:  
  <li>Interaction Heat Map:  
  <li>SAR Heat Map:

</ol>

<h2><a name="heatmap"></a>MOEDivcon Heat Map</h2>
<p>
The <w>QB Heat Map</w> is used to implement the interaction energy map and the
structure-activity relationship (SAR) map.  The interaction energy map is based
on the absolute <em>E</em><sub>AB</sub> terms from PWD, which  makes it
easy to identify the residues that have the largest absolute effect on ligand
binding.  The SAR map consists of the most important residue-ligand interaction
terms derived from the PLS analysis of all the interaction terms (attractive
and repulsive), which highlights residues that are most critical to discriminating
between more and less potent ligands (see the PWD section for more details).
Below is an example SAR map.

<p>
Note that ligand and residue names are abbreviated so that they fit into the
heat map.  If you hover the mouse over the abreviated names, a bubble appears
with the full name.  If you hover over a color-coded cell, the full corresponding 
ligand and residue names as well as the interaction value appears in the bubble.
<p>
The <w>QB Heat Map</w> is interactive.  When first invoked, a Connolly molecular
surface of the pocket is generated.  Then, depending on the user selection, the
corresponding residues along the molecular surface are colored 
according to their interaction values in the heap map.  An example of such a
surface (ligand 6 of the heat map is selected) is shown below.

<h3><a name="heatmap-selection"></a>Selection</h3>
<p>
There are three types of interactive selections you can make.  If you select a
ligand, the chosen ligand  is loaded into the MOE Window and the molecular
surface is recolored to show the values for all residues in the heat map for
that ligand.  If you select a residue, the ligand and surface do not
change, but the chosen residue is labeled and the view zooms in on it.  If
you select a color-coded cell, the corresponding ligand is loaded into the MOE 
Window and the molecular surface is recolored to show only the value for the
corresponding residue, which is also labeled.

<h3><a name="heatmap-saveprint"></a>Save and Print</h3>
<p>
You can save a publication quality image of the <w>QB Heat Map</w> by
clicking the <w>Save</w>  button.  MOE's <w>Graphic Export Panel</w> is used
to save the image.  Note that the default background is transparent.  If you
wish a white background, select the color white under the <w>Background</w>
option in the bottom right corner.  An example is shown below.
<p>
<object id="QMPWDHeatMapSave" title="QBPWD Heat Map Save"

</object>
<p>
Likewise, MOE's <w>Print Preview Panel</w> is used to print
the <w>QB Heat Map</w> when you click the <w>Print</w> button.

<h3><a name="heatmap-animation"></a>Animation</h3>
<p>
When you click on the <w>Animate</w> button, the <w>QB Heat Map</w> is
temporarily hidden, and each ligand is sequentially selected beginning with
the topmost one.  That is, each ligand is loaded into the MOE Window and
the molecular surface is recolored.  When all ligands have been shown, the
<w>QB Heat Map</w> reappears.

<h3><a name="heatmap-setup"></a>Configuration</h3>
<p>
The <w>QB-PWD</w> panel contains several options you can use to
set up the <w>QB Heat Map</w> as shown below.

<p>

<h4><a name="heatmap-setup-cutoff"></a>Cutoff</h4>
<p>
If <w>Cutoff</w> is selected, the standard deviation of a subset of the heat
map values is used to determine minimum and maximum cutoffs; otherwise, the
absolute minimum and maximum values are used.  In addition, you can specify
in the <w>Number of sima</w> field, how standard deviations are used to
determine the minimum and maximum values of the color scale.  Values smaller
than the minimum are assigned the same color as the minimum and
values greater than the maximum are assigned the same color as the maximum.

<h4><a name="heatmap-setup-numcolors"></a>Number of Colors</h4>
<p>
The number of different colors used to generate the color scale for the heat map.

<h4><a name="heatmap-setup-mono"></a>Monochromatic</h4>
<p>
If <w>Monochromatic</w> is selected, a single color (red for positive,
blue for negative) is used to generate the color scale.  Otherwise,
a rainbow spectrum of colors is used (as was seen above).  The same heat map
with the monochromatic option is shown below.
<p>
<object id="QMPWDHeatMapMono" title="QBPWD Heat Map Mono"

<p>

<h4><a name="heatmap-setup-numticks"></a>Number of Ticks</h4>
<p>
The number of ticks to display on the color scale showing the values
represented by the colors.

We list here potential problems using the MOEDivcon integration and possible
solutions.  If your problem is not listed here or the proposed solution
doesn't help, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> support.
<ui>
  <li><p><prob>
    The QuantumBio submenu is not appearing in the MOE menu system.
    </prob>
    <p><sol>MOE requires that custom menu files
    (<inline>moe-menus</inline>) reside in the user's home directory.
    See the <a href="#install-menu">installation</a> section.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:

    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    MOE's <inline>run</inline> function is unable to find the MOEDivcon SVL
    scripts.  Make sure the <inline>MOE_SVL_RUNPATH</inline> is
    set up correctly (see the <a href="#install-path">installation</a>
    section).
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
    qb_QMScore: fwrite: Broken pipe.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    MOE is unable to find the MOEDivcon executables.  Make sure the
    <inline>PATH</inline> is
    set up correctly (see the <a href="#install-path">installation</a>
    section).
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the message in the <w>Status</w> field of the QMScore database:
    <pre>
Error:   LICENSE ERROR: Problem with license file. Error Code: 1003.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    MOEDivcon is distributed with an evaluation license which eventually
    expires.  See the <a href="#install-license">installation</a>
    section for more information on purchasing and installing a license.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    DivCon isn't generating a log file (<inline><em>divcon.log</em></inline>).
    </prob><p><sol>
    A logging configuration file <inline>divcon-log.config</inline> has to be
    in the working directory or in <inline>$QBHOME/etc</inline>.  The
    configuration file in the working directory takes precendence.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    MOEDivcon doesn't always include the hostname in the location for the 
    log file written in the <w>Status</w> field of the QMScore database.
    </prob><p><sol>
    Moebatch uses a ssh command to remotely execute MOEDivcon jobs, which
    doesn't always set the <inline>HOSTNAME</inline> environment variable.
    To ensure that the hostname always appears, add the following line to your 
    .bashrc file:
    <pre>
export HOSTNAME=`hostname`
    </pre>
    </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
"filename.mdb" is not a QMScore Database.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    The MOE database that you are attempting to load isn't a QMScore database.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
No molecular complex loaded in MOE Window.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    When using QMScore in 'One-to-One' or 'One-to-Many' mode, you need to first
    open the molecule files (.pdb, .moe, etc.) of the complex (or receptor and
    ligand separately) into MOE.  MOEDivcon populates the QMScore database with
    the molecular data in the MOE Window.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
No ligand was recognized.  Use LigX to define it.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    For most protein/ligand complexes, MOE should be able to identify the ligand
    using its heuristics.  However in smaller systems, especially when the
    receptor has been cut, the ligand isn't always easily picked out.  You can
    assist the process with this quick guide to LigX.
    <ol>
      <li> Start LigX by pressing the <w>LigX</w> button in the right button
           bar.
      <li> Select an atom in the ligand.
      <li> Extend the selection to entire molecule by using the main or pop-up
           menu:
      <w>Selection</w> or <w>Select</w>&rarr;<w>Extend</w>&rarr;<w>Molecule</w>.
      <li> Tell LigX to mark the selected molecule as the ligand. In the right
           button bar, select <w>Prepare</w>&rarr;<w>Choose Ligand</w>.
      <li> Press the <w>Quit LigX</w> to exit from LigX.
      <li> Note that LigX alters the MOE View for pocket elucidation.  To 
           clean up the View, perform the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li> From the right button bar, 
                     select <w>Show</w>&rarr;<w>All</w>.
                <li> From the right button bar,
                     select <w>Color</w>&rarr;<w>Element</w>.
            </ol>
    </ol>
    MOEDivcon should now be able to identify the ligand.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
Ligand has to be a single molecule.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    The current version of QMScore expects one receptor and one ligand.  The
    receptor may comprise many chains, solvents, etc.  The ligand has to
    a single molecule.  If your problem involves multiple ligands within the
    same complex, we recommend you isolate each ligand for independent
    analysis.  Or <a href=#contact>contact</a> our scientific support group
    to resolve this issue in a future release.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
Problematic molecule in receptor and/or ligand.  Continue anyway?
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    MOEDivcon has detected that there is a problem with the structure
    of either the receptor or ligand.  You should try to address the problem
    before running or saving the QMScore database.  MOEDivcon will skip the
    calculation of molecules with problematic structures.  You can learn
    what the problem is by clicking the <w>Perform</w> button in the
    <w>Molecule Tests</w> section with the "Error" tests selected.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
Problematic charge for receptor and/or ligand.  Continue anyway?
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    MOEDivcon has detected that there is a problem with the charge
    of either the receptor or ligand.  The problematic molecule should be marked
    red in the <w>Charge</w> section.  You should try to address the problem
    before running or saving the QMScore database.  MOEDivcon will skip the
    calculation of molecules with problematic charges.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    In the <w>Status</w> field of the QMScore database, I get the message:
    <pre>
Error:  Problematic receptor and/or ligand.
    </pre>
or
    <pre>
Warning:  Problematic receptor and/or ligand.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    You should get error or warning messages about a problematic molecules when 
    creating or saving a QMScore database (see the 
    <a href="#test">Molecule Tests</a> section for more information).
    You can right-click on the problematic molecule in the MOE Database Viewer,
    select <w>Send to MOE</w> from the popup menu, cleanup the molecule with
    MOE's suite of tools, then save it back in the database by right-clicking
    on the same molecule in the MOE  Database Viewer and
    selecting <w>Get from MOE</w> from the popup menu.  You may also wish to
    save the cleaned up molecule in its original format.
    <p>
    You can also use your favorite molecule editor to fix the problems using
    the original molecule files, then rebuild the QMScore database using the
    modified molecule files.

Error:  Problematic charge for receptor and/or ligand.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    You should get a error messages about problematic charges when creating 
    or saving a QMScore database.  The preferred solution is to cleanup the
    molecule:  Right-click on the problematic molecule in the MOE Database
    Viewer,
    select <w>Send to MOE</w> from the popup menu, cleanup the molecule with
    MOE's suite of tools, then save it back in the database by right-clicking

    Or you can simply edit the charge in the MOE database (see the
    <a href="#charge-editing">charge</a> section).
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
The MOEDivcon database hasn't been created.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    You are attempting to check the charges in the current QMScore database
    that hasn't been saved yet.  From the QMScore panel, ether save or load
    the QMScore database before continuing.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
The MOEDivcon database isn't open.

    </prob><p><sol>
    MOEDivcon cannot determine which is the correct molecule field for the
    poses (receptors) if there is more than one.  Copy the correct field into
    a new MOE database.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
"filename1.mdb"  and "filename2.mdb"  are the same database.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
The QMScore database needs to a different database than the receptor and pose
databases.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    When setting up QMScore in <w>Many-to-Many</w> mode, I get the MOE message:
    <pre>
The receptor and pose databases have different number of entries.
    </pre>
    </prob><p><sol>
    In <w>Many-to-Many</w> mode, there should be a separate ligand/pose in the
    ligand/pose database for each receptor in the receptor database.  Verify
    that the databases specified in the QMScore panel are the correct ones.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    I submitted a parallel PBS (SGE, etc.) QMScore batch script and it returned
    immediately without executing any jobs.
    </prob><p><sol>
    If the script requested more processors than the number of available MOE
    licenses, moebatch will fail. Sometimes an error message explaining
    the reason will make it back to the stderr, more often not.
    </sol>
    <p><sol>
    There may be configuration problems.  Please <a href=#contact>contact</a>
    our support staff to resolve the issue.
  </sol>
  <li><p><prob>
    How do I know when all jobs of a MOEDivcon batch run have completed, or
    more importantly, are likely to converge.
    </prob><p><sol>
    Presently, MOEDivcon has no mechanism to show the user the progress of a
    calculation or whether it is converging.  This will be addressed in a future
    release of MOEDivcon.
