THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE BEING EndOfLifed!

*** DO NOT EDIT OR USE THESE FILES WITHOUT RISK OF LOSS ***

We have converted from DivCon5 to DivCon6 (e.g. qmechanic) and we are moving
our SVL product to follow suit. DivCon6 is much faster, better performant, and
in most ways more complete.

The focus of the SVL work with DivCon6 Suite has been the development of refinement
tools. We are now updating the tool to use PWD, NMR, and interaction profiling.
QMScore will be available at a later date.

Therefore, the files in this directory will be removed and/or moved to other
parts of the QuantumBio Suite over the course of this year.
